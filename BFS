BFS of graph 
Given a directed graph. The task is to do Breadth First Search of this graph.

Input:
The first line of the input contains an integer 'T' denoting the number of test cases. Then 'T' test cases follow. Each test case consists of two lines. Description of testcases is as follows: The First line of each test case contains two integers 'N' and 'E'  which denotes the no of vertices and no of edges respectively. The Second line of each test case contains 'E'  space separated pairs u and v denoting that there is a edge from u to v .

Output:
For each testcase, print the BFS of the graph starting from 0.

Note: The expected output button always produces BFS starting from node 0.

User Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function bfs() takes the Graph and the number of vertices as its input and returns a list containing the BFS traversal of the graph starting from the 0th vertex.

Expected Time Complexity: O(V + E).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(V).

Solution -->

class Traversal {
    static ArrayList<Integer> bfs(ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>> list, int nov) {
         boolean vis[] = new boolean[nov];
            for (int i = 0; i < nov; i++) vis[i] = false;
            
        int src = 0;
        ArrayList<Integer> res = new ArrayList<Integer>(0);
        Queue<Integer> q = new LinkedList<>();
        vis[src] = true;      // Intially mark source vertex as visited(true)
        q.add(src);           // Push the source vertex to queue
        while (q.size() != 0) // Till queue is not empty
        {
            src = q.poll();
            res.add (src);
            Iterator<Integer> it = list.get(src).iterator();
            while (it.hasNext()) // Traverse through all the connected
                                 // components of front
            {
                int n = it.next();
                if (!vis[n]) // If they are not visited, mark them visited and
                             // add to queue
                {
                    vis[n] = true;
                    q.add(n);
                }
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
